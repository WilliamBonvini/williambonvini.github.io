Hi everyone, my name is William Bonvini. \\
I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from Politecnico di Milano, currently interested in Reinforcement Learning applications. \\
I like to write blogposts to better understand what I'm doing, you'll find some here. \\
In this website you can find my latest works, any share-worthy news, and a high level description of what I like doing. \\
Feel free to reach me out on any platform (contacts in the footer). \\
Cheers!
