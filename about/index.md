# About

{% epigraph " Now this is a story all about how
my life got flipped, turned upside down, and I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there,
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air." "Will Smith" ' "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, 1990" ' %}


I was born on the 24th of July 1996 in Milan. I lived almost my whole life in Saronno, a small city in northern Italy. I spent my 4th year of High School in Nova Scotia, Canada and did my university studies at Politecnico di Milano, where I graduated in April 2021. I particularly enjoyed my time at Politecnico, where I found a very collaborative environment and developed a taste for writing. \\
Other than that, I've always had an interest in music and started playing the guitar at a young age (you can find my Spotify handle in the footer!). \\
You can find the list of my most recent contributions on my [GitHub](https://github.com/WilliamBonvini) page.



## Work

I've been working since June 2021 for an italian company, Machine Learning Reply, where I've been in charge of refactoring an internal project and managed to obtain a 50% speed up in execution time. \\
Currently I'm following a research project that consists in analyzing a corpus of textual data to extract meaningful topics and identify relationships among them. \\
During this experience I've managed to teach a short course at Politecnico di Torino on GCP, organized hackathons and bootcamps on deep learning applications (mostly image classification tasks), and developed a few python libraries that are currently used by my development team.

## Academic Work
+ **Unsupervised Learning for Multi-Model Consensus Maximization** - A Deep approach for fitting multiple parametric models in an unsupervised fashion from point clouds. Check it out [here](https://github.com/WilliamBonvini/ulmmcm).

+ **Syndalib** - a Python library to generate data points for multi-class multi-model problems. Check it out [here](https://github.com/WilliamBonvini/syndalib).

## Studies

+ **MSc in Computer Science and Engineering** at Politecnico di Milano (September 2018 - April 2021)
+ **BSc in Computer Science and Engineering** at Politecnico di Milano (September 2015 - September 2018)
+ **Scientific Lyceum G.B. Grassi** (2010 - 2015) - **Avon View High School** (2014)


## Talks & Competitions
+ Held speech at Reply Exchange Conference on multi-task learning neural networks. (July 2022)
+ Held 4 days course on GCP technologies at Politecnico di Torino (May 2022)
+ Held 12 hours hackathon on image recognition task at Politecnico di Milano (April 2022)
+ Organized and held 8 hour long bootcamp on deep learning (April 2022)


## Hobbies
+ I've been busking (I play the guitar, a friend of mine sings) in the streets of Milan since 2015.
+ Once in a while I gather some friends and make short movies. We usually constrain ourselves to do everything in 48 hours, so if you happen to watch one and you don't like it, we are excused. 
+ I enjoy running and do any kind of group sport activities. Running just happens to be free and I don't need friends to do it.
