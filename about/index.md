# About

I was born on the 24th of July 1996 in Milan. I lived almost my whole life in Saronno, a small town in northern Italy. I spent my 4th year of High School in Nova Scotia, Canada and did my university studies at Politecnico di Milano. I graduated in April 2021 and started working for a company that develops end to end ML solutions. At first I was put in charge to refactor and optimize a financial KPIs analysis tool for my company, and now I'm doing a research project to extract topics and meaningful relationships among data in a corpus of documents.

{% epigraph " Now this is a story all about how
my life got flipped, turned upside down, and I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there,
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air." "Will Smith" ' "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, 1990" ' %}

## Hobbies
+ I've been busking (I play the guitar, a friend of mine sings) in the streets of Milan since 2015.
+ Once in a while I gather up some friends and we make short movies. We usually constrain ourselves to do everything in 48 hours, so if you don't like them we are excused. 
+ I enjoy running
