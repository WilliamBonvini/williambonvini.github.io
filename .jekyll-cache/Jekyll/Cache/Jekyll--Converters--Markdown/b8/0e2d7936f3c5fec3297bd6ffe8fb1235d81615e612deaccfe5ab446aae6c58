<h1 id="about">About</h1>

<p>I was born on the 24th of July 1996 in Milan. I lived almost my whole life in Saronno, a small town in northern Italy. I spent my 4th year of High School in Nova Scotia, Canada and did my university studies at Politecnico di Milano. I graduated in April 2021 and started working for a company that develops end to end ML solutions. At first I was put in charge to refactor and optimize a financial KPIs analysis tool for my company, and now Iâ€™m doing a research project to extract topics and meaningful relationships among data in a corpus of documents.</p>
