<p>The Beta distribution is a continuous distribution that is often dubbed as the probability distribution of probabilities. This is because it can only take on value between $0$ and $1$.</p>

<p>It is used to infer the probability of an event when we have some information about the volumes of successes and failure.</p>

<h3 id="probability-density-function">Probability Density Function</h3>

<p>The probability density function of the Beta distribution is
\(f(x)= \frac{x^{\alpha - 1}(1-x)^{\beta - 1}}{B(\alpha, \beta)}\)</p>

<p>where \(0\le x \le 1\), therefore it can be interpreted as a <strong>probability</strong> as we mentioned above.</p>

<p>It is parametrised by two variables $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and \(B(\alpha, \beta)\) is the <strong>beta function</strong> which is the normalising constant:
\(B(\alpha, \beta)= \frac{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha + \beta)}\)
where \(\Gamma(\alpha)\) is the <strong>Gamma function</strong>
\(\Gamma(\alpha) = (\alpha - 1)!\)</p>

<p>Putting it all together:
\(f(x) = \frac{x^{\alpha - 1}(1-x)^{\beta - 1}}{\frac{(\alpha-1)!(\beta-1)!}{(\alpha+\beta-1)!}}\)</p>

<p>Let’s now focus only on the numerator though, because the denominator is just a normalizing factor that is needed to bound the result in the interval \([0, 1]\).
\(x^{\alpha - 1}(1-x)^{\beta - 1}\)
You can thon of \(\alpha - 1\) as the number of successes and \(\beta - 1\) as the number of failures.</p>

<p>You can choose the \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) parameters however you think they are supposed to be. If you think the probability of success is very high, let’s say \(90\%\), set \(90\) for \(\alpha\) and \(10\) for \(\beta\).</p>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p>Let’s say how likely someone would agree to go on a date with you follows a Beta distribution with \(\alpha=2\) and \(\beta=8\).  <br />
What is the probability that your success rate will be greater than \(50\%\)?
\(P(X&gt;0.5)=1-CDF(0.5)=0.01953\)</p>
