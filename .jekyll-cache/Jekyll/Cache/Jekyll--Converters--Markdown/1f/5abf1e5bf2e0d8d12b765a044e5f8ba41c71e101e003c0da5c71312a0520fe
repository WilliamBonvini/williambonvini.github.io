<div class="epigraph"><blockquote><p> Now this is a story all about how
my life got flipped, turned upside down, and I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there,
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air.</p><footer>Will Smith, <cite> "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, 1990" </cite></footer></blockquote></div>

<p>I was born on the 24th of July 1996 in Milan. I lived almost my whole life in Saronno, a small city in northern Italy. I spent my 4th year of High School in Nova Scotia, Canada and did my university studies at Politecnico di Milano, where I graduated in April 2021. I particularly enjoyed my time at Politecnico, where I found a very collaborative environment and developed a taste for writing. <br />
Other than that, Iâ€™ve always had an interest in music and started playing the guitar at a young age (you can find my Spotify handle in the footer!). <br />

<h2 id="work">Work</h2>

<p>Iâ€™ve been working since June 2021 for an italian company, Machine Learning Reply, where Iâ€™ve been in charge of refactoring an internal project and managed to obtain a 50% speed up in execution time. <br />
Currently Iâ€™m following a research project that consists in analyzing a corpus of textual data to extract meaningful topics and identify relationships among them. <br />
During this experience Iâ€™ve managed to teach a short course at Politecnico di Torino on GCP, organized hackathons and bootcamps on deep learning applications (mostly image classification tasks), and developed a few python libraries that are currently used by my development team.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Iâ€™ve been busking (I play the guitar, a friend of mine sings) in the streets of Milan since 2015.</li>
  <li>Once in a while I gather some friends and make short movies. We usually constrain ourselves to do everything in 48 hours, so if you happen to watch one and you donâ€™t like it, we are excused.</li>
  <li>I enjoy running and do any kind of group sport activities. Running just happens to be free and I donâ€™t need friends to do it.</li>
</ul>
