I"~<p>Hi everyone, my name is William Bonvini. <br />
I’m a recent Computer Science graduate from Politecnico di Milano, currently interested in Reinforcement Learning applications. <br />
I like to write blogposts to better understand what I’m doing, you’ll find some here. <br />
Here you can find my latest works, any share-worthy news, and a high level description of what I like doing. <br />
Feel free to reach me out on any platform (contacts in the footer), <br />
Cheers! \</p>
