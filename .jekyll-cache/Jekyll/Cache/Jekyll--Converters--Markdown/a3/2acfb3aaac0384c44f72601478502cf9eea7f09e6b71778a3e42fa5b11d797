<h1 id="bio">Bio</h1>

<p>I was born in 1996 in Milan and lived almost my whole life in Saronno, a small city in northern Italy. I studied Computer Science at Politecnico di Milano, where I graduated in April 2021. <br />
I particularly enjoyed my time at Politecnico, where I found a very collaborative environment and developed a taste for writing scientific material.<br />
Other than that, Iâ€™ve always had an interest in music and started playing the guitar at a young age: Occasionally I perform in the streets of Milan.</p>
