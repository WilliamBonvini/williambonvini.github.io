I"‡<p>Hi everyone, my name is William Bonvini. <br />
Iâ€™m a recent Computer Science graduate from Politecnico di Milano, currently interested in Reinforcement Learning applications. <br />
I like to write blogposts to better understand what Iâ€™m doing, youâ€™ll find some here. <br />
In this website you can find my latest works, any share-worthy news, and a high level description of what I like doing. <br />
Feel free to reach me out on any platform (contacts in the footer). <br />
Cheers!</p>
