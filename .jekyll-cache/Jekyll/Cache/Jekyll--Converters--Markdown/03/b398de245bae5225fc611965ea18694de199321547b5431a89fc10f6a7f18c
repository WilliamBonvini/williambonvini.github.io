I"L<p>Hi everyone, my name is William Bonvini. I’m a recent Computer Science graduate from Politecnico di Milano, currently interested in Reinforcement Learning applications. <br />
I like to write blogposts to better understand what I’m doing. You’ll find some here. <br />
This is my personal webpage, where you can find my latest works, news, and a very high level description of what I like doing.</p>

<h2 id="blogs">Blogs</h2>

<p>In this section you’ll find my latest articles</p>

<h3 id="posts">Posts</h3>

<p>Conceptually, posts are for recurring pieces of similar content such as might be found in a typical blog entry. Post content all sits in a folder named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> and files are created in this folder<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Yes, a page has essentially the same old shit as a post </span> that are names with a date pre-pended to the title of the post. For instance <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2105-02-20-this-is-a-post.md</code> is a perfectly valid post filename.</p>

<p>Posts will always have a section above the content itself consisting of YAML front matter, which is meta-data information about the post. Minimally, a post title must always be present for it to be processed properly.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
Title: Some Title
---
## Content

Markdown formatted content *here*.
</code></pre></div></div>
