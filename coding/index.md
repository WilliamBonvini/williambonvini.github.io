# Libraries

I've written some Python libraries. Some of them are now used internally in the company I currently work at.

+ **syndalib**: a library to synthesize data points of parametric models (in particular conics, homographies, and fundamental matrices). It lets you specify a percentage of noise and outliers contamination. Check it out on Github at [this](https://github.com/WilliamBonvini/syndalib) link.

+ **cloudbridge**: a Python library that centralizes AWS & GCP cloud connectors in one place, while simplifying their usage and offering advanced functionalities.

+ **databridge**: a library that works ass an abstraction layer between Python and different database syntaxes.

+ **celorya**: a Python library that lets you load and manipulate database tables directly to xlsx files through a simple yml file.
